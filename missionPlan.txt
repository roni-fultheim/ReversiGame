Location: as is (R)

Board:
	Enum matrix
	getter -> private (R)
	boolean functions -> to add (R)
	empty cells vector (Y)
	IDEA: nothing outside of board should knwo how the board is implemented
	
Player:
	same, split move(Y) function into hasNextMove(R), getNextMove(take from y) - returns index (int) in possible moves vector

HumanPlayer: create (ConsolePlayer/HumanPlayer)

View, ConsoleView: as is (Y)

Menu: create (accept new)
